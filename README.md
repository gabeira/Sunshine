Sunshine
========

Sunshine is the companion Android app for the Udacity courses [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853) and [Advanced Android App Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud855).

Take the course to find out how to build this app a step at a time, and eventually create your own Android App!


### Open Weather Map API Key is required.

In order for the Sunshine app to function properly as of October 18th, 2015 an API key for openweathermap.org must be included with the build.

We recommend for you to obtain a key via the following [instructions](http://openweathermap.org/appid#use), and include the unique key for the build by adding the following line to [USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties

`MyOpenWeatherMapApiKey="<UNIQUE_API_KEY">`
